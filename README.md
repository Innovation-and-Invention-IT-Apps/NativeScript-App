# NativeScript-App

This is a very basic NativeScript Android & iOS App. But if you really want to see a good NS App with Angular2 and TypeScript then you can find it here

This App has Spring Boot Microservices and MongoDB integration and should get you complete/better understanding of NativeScript and services integration.

Let me know if you face any challenges.
